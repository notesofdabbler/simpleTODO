# simpleTODO

This is a small project that I am doing for myself to learn a bit of python and flask but along the way create a simpleTODO app for myself. Lot of material here is based on learning from the Udacity Course [Full Stack Foundations](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088)
